# JupyterHub-docker

This Docker Image contains an easy setup and deployment of JupyterHub ( A JupyterLab Web Server )

[Method #1](https://github.com/skymotic/JupyterHub-docker#method-1-from-docker-repository)
*Pull Docker Image from a Docker Repository* (Easy Difficulty)

[Method #2](https://github.com/skymotic/JupyterHub-docker#method-2-build-from-files)
*Build the Docker Image from the* `Dockerfile` *in this GitHub* (Medium Difficulty)

[Creating Login](https://github.com/skymotic/JupyterHub-docker#creating-login)
*Instructions to create your login once the Docker Container is running*

# Method #1: From Docker Repository
The quickest and easiest way to host this JupyterHub server is to pull it from my docker repository.  
You can *pull* and *run* the image all with one command,but first make sure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed on you system

```bash
docker run -d -p 8000:8000 lobr266238/jupyterhub-basic:1.0
```
> Notice the `-d` option; This allows us to start the container in *Headless Mode* or detached from the current shell

> Notice the `-p 8000:8000` option; This opens the port 8000 on the host machine so we can connect the web server  
> `8000:8000` specifies both the Host machines port and the containers port in order: `<HostPort>:<DockerPort>`  
> If you would like to open this container on a differnt port subsitute this: `-p <NewPort>:8000`

> `lobr266238/jupyterhub-basic:1.0` calls Docker to look at Account: `lobr266238`, Repository: `jupyterhub-basic`, Tag: `1.0`

# Method #2: Build From Files
In order to do this method, you will need to download the `Dockerfile` from this repository and put it in its own folder before continuing
## Docker Build Process

1. Make sure [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) is installed on you system

2. In the command line, navigate to the Directory your `Dockerfile` is in (for example `/apps/jupyter`)

3. Run the Docker Build command where `<NAME>` is whatever you choose:

   ```bash
   docker build -t <NAME> .
   ```
   > Notice the `-t` option; This is to *tag* the image with a name. The name has to be all lowercase
   
   > Notice the `.` at the end of the command; This is very intentional.  
   > This singnals the Docker command to look for the Dockerfile in the `pwd` or *Present Working Directory*

   The build process should start; Depending on the machine it can take a little while

4. Once the build had finished, enter the following to ensure your image was created

   ```bash  
   docker images
   ```
   >You should see an image with the *tag* you set earlier in step 3  


## Start Docker Container

By default, the image is configured be started and immediately ready to use.

1. To start a container from the image we just built, do the following:

   ```bash  
   docker run -d -p 8000:8000 <ImageName>
   ```  
   > Notice the `-d` option: This allows us to start the container detached from your current shell session

   > Notice the `-p 8000:8000` option: This exposes port 8000 to your host system.  
   > 8000 is the default JupyterHub port.  
   > `-p <HostPort>:<ContainerPort>`
   
   >`<ImageName>` is the name you had set earlier in the *Docker Build Process*

# Creating Login

By defualt, the docker's container uses PAM for authentication (which is intigreated for the containers OS users)  
In order to create a login for yourself or others to use for jupyterhub server, you will need to enter the container shell and add the users:

1. Getting the container ID

   ```bash
   docker ps
   ```  
   > Notice the `ps` command shows all running docker containers
   
   Find the running container and copy the ID shown
   
2. Entering the Container's shell where `<ContainerID>` is the ID from the last step

   ```bash
   docker exec -it <ContainerID> /bin/bash
   ```  
   > Notice the `exec` command allows you to execute a command on the docker container
   
   > Notice the `-it` option allows us to enter commands in *Interactive Mode*
   
   > Notice the `/bin/bash` allows us to enter into a full interactive shell
   
3. Once in the Container's shell we will need to add each user

   ```bash
   adduser <USERNAME>
   ```  
   You can repeat this command for as many users as you need. (I will be working on a way to add users by script)
   
4. This should allow you to sign into the jupyter server with the user you have created

### DONE
The Docker Image should be built, and you should now have a running docker container with a working JupyterHub Server  
To get to the webpage go to <http://localhost:8000/>

### External Website
If you want to connect this to a domain and external website, I'd strongly recommend that you set up an Nginx or Apache reverse proxy using SSL and a firewall
